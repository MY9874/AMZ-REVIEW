# This is an NLP project of predicting Amazon product rating using review

This project includes several NLP models, using review as input and star rating as output

The model includes basic RNN, RNN with GRU unit, RNN with LSTM unit, SVM, Perceptron, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

The word embedding method includes tf-idf and Word2Vec

- tfidf.py is the implementation of models with tf-idf word embedding


- word2vec.py is the implementation of models with Word2Vec embedding


- Developed on Python 3.8
- Used PyTorch framework
